# Criticality levels:
# - critical: Compromise would cause severe damage (production data, credentials)
# - high: Significant business impact (customer data, internal systems)
# - medium: Moderate impact (non-production data, limited scope)
# - low: Minimal impact (test data, publicly available information)
